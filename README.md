Netflix-Themed Portfolio Website
Welcome to my Netflix-Themed Portfolio Website, a dynamic and visually engaging platform designed to showcase my skills, projects, and competitive programming achievements. Inspired by Netflix's sleek interface, this portfolio features a dark theme with red accents, smooth animations, and a responsive layout that adapts to all devices. The "Coding Skills" section, styled in a 3x2 grid, highlights my profiles on platforms like LeetCode, CodeChef, and Codeforces with a Netflix-style hover effect.
